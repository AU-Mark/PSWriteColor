Write-Color is a wrapper around Write-Host delivering a lot of additional features for easier color options for native powershell, ANSI SGR, ANSI 4-bit color, and ANSI 8-bit color support. It provides easy manipulation of colors, logging output to file (log) and nice formatting options out of the box.
